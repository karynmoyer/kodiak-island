## Scope

Kodiak Island will be hosted on Karyn Lyn Moyer's website.

My first instinct is it should be developed separately, as a module or as it's own site entirely.

## History

It will implement a pseudo-role playing gaming developed about back in 2015 that puts players somewhere in the interior of Kodiak Island, Alaska. The players initially had to "race" each other to a particular port.

It was created as a tabletop style rpg that eschewed the need for a GM/DM (game master/dungeon master). It was to be survival based in nature.

### Original Intent

The intention of creating this game was to give college writing students a means of testing various theories regarding something tangible--namely--surviving the kodiak wilderness with certain equipment and knowledge. The students were expected to do real research beforehand, develop hypotheses regarding what the experience would be like, play the game (and thus test their hypotheses), and then write a research paper (in the form of a Survival Guide).

## Description

The game will essentially be text based, at first.
